## VOlume Merger for MPI


### Abstract
VOMMPI (Volume Merger for MPI) is a simple software tool for merging patches of MPI images obtained using an MPI patch sequence implemented by Bruker Individual patches are shifted by focus fields .
Software reads reconstructed data produced by a field free point scanner (We used: MPI 25 20 FF, Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH). 
A series of patches is merged into the final 3D volume data and exported processed data in DICOM format
